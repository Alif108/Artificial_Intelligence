This repository contains the offlines (assignments) I did in my CSE_318 (Artificial Intelligence) course in BUET Level-3, Term-2.



## Offline_1

Implementing n-puzzle problem with A* search algorithm using different heuristics (Hamming Distance, Manhattan Distance, Linear Conflict).


## Offline_2

Implementing Mancala, a two-player board game using Adversarial Search. Minimax as well as Minimax with Alpha Beta Pruning has been applied here with different heursitics and depth-limit.
