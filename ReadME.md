This repository containts several basic Artificial Intelligence problems and their solutions.
It includes the offlines (assignments) I did in my CSE_318 (Artificial Intelligence) course in BUET Level-3, Term-2.



## Offline_1 (A* Search)

Implementing n-puzzle problem with A* search algorithm using different heuristics (Hamming Distance, Manhattan Distance, Linear Conflict).


## Offline_2 (Adversarial Search)

Implementing Mancala, a two-player board game using Adversarial Search. Minimax as well as Minimax with Alpha Beta Pruning has been applied here with different heursitics and depth-limit.


## Offline_3 (Hidden Markov Model)

Predicting location of a ghost in a room based on evidence using Hidden Markov Model.


## Online on CSP (Constraint Satisfaction Problem)

Solving classic Sudoku and Killer_Sudoku (also called Sumdoku) with java based CSP solver Choco-solver.


## Simulated Annealing

Implementing local search algorithm "Simulated Annealing" in python

## A star search

Implementation of the n-puzzle problem (in python), grid solving problem and shortest path finding problem using A* search.

## Prolog

Logics of several family relationships written in prolog.
